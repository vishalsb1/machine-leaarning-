fit_transform() is a shortcut that combines fitting (learning) and transforming (applying the learned transformation) into a single step.
Itâ€™s commonly used in data preprocessing tasks such as scaling, encoding, or imputing.
Use it on the training data to both compute and apply transformations in one go.
